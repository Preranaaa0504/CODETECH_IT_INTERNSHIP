OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT - 

TASK 1 - STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Create a student management system that can handle student registrations, maintain student records, and calculate grades. The system should allow adding, editing, and deleting student information.
PURPOSE: Manage student records with functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and displaying student information.
KEY COMPONENTS:
1) Student Class (Student):
Attributes: name, rollNumber, grade.
Methods: setStudentInfo() for inputting data and displayInfo() for outputting details.
2) Student Management System Class (StudentManagementSystem):
Attributes: students array, studentCount.
Methods: A) isRollNumberTaken(int rollNumber): Checks if a roll number is already in use.
B) addStudent(): Adds a new student if roll number is unique.
C) editStudent(): Modifies student details, ensuring roll number uniqueness.
D) deleteStudent(): Removes a student by roll number.
E) displayStudent(): Shows details of a specific student.
F) displayStudentData(): Lists all stored students.
MAIN FUNCTION: Presents a menu-driven interface for user interaction. Options include adding, editing, deleting, and viewing student records.
IMPLEMENTATION: Ensures data integrity by validating roll number uniqueness and provides a user-friendly interface for efficient management of student information.

TASK 2 - TEMPERATURE CONVERTER
Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program should allow the user to input a temperature in one scale and output the converted temperature in another scale.
PURPOSE - The program allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales based on user input, providing a practical tool for temperature conversion needs.
COMPONENTS:
1) Functions for Conversion: Conversion functions for Celsius to Fahrenheit, Celsius to Kelvin, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, Kelvin to Celsius, and Kelvin to Fahrenheit.
2) Main Functionality: A) Menu-driven interface using cout and cin for user interaction.
B) Switch statement to execute the selected conversion function based on user input.
C) Displays the converted temperature after performing the conversion.
3) Highlights: A) Modular functions ensure clarity and reusability for each conversion type.
B) Simple user interface guides users through temperature conversions effectively.
C) Supports comprehensive temperature scale conversions commonly used in various contexts.
